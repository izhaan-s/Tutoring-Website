                <p>Founded by Ishtiaque Akbar and Izhaan Salam, we noticed how difficult finding a tutor was, every tutoring website you will find a list of 100+ people all with A/A*s in Maths but that does NOT prove you would be a right tutor for a student.</p>
                <p>To solve this issue, on our platform every single tutor on our platform have videos of them explaining concepts/questions in the subject they are teaching, this way students can see if the tutor explains in a way that they understand and benefit from the most.</p>
                <p>All you have to do is select on our tutors profiles, preview their videos to see if you like their style of teaching and then fill out a form showing interest in being tought and the times which work best between you and the tutor and it's as easy as that!</p>
                <p>Our approach not only saves money as you wont have to pay only to find out in the first session that the tutor you paid for does not teach in a way you understand the most.</p>

                    <p><i>"Ishtiaque has helped me understand concepts in A Level Maths very well, we go over exam questions every lesson and he always pushes me outside my comfort zone making me think about the next steps to solve questions which has made me very prepared for tests and exams."</i></p>
